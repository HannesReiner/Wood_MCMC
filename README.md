Codes related to publication 'Machine Learning Supported Bayesian Inference on Finite Element Input Parameters to Simulate Uncertainty in Progressive Fracture Tests of Thin Wood Veneer Laminates''

This is a collection of codes to reproduce results presented in the paper. The following outline explains the codes related to the different sections of the manuscript:

1) Machine learning Surrogate Model (Section 3.2): This contains the FEA-generated force vs displacement curves and the codes to train the LSTM neural networks.
2) Uncertainty Quantification (Section 4): Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods to infer FEA input parameters
