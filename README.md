Codes related to publication 'Machine Learning Supported Bayesian Inference on Finite Element Input Parameters to Simulate Uncertainty in Progressive Fracture Tests of Thin Wood Veneer Laminates''

This is a collection of codes to reproduce results presented in the paper. The following outline explains the codes related to the different sections of the manuscript.
Calibration of FEA inputs via LSTM surrogate modelling and uncertainty quantification via MCMC related to Section 3 and 4:
1) The '90' folder contains the python code (Calibration90.ipynb), alongside all files to run the code.
2) The '45' folder contains the python code (Calibration45.ipynb), alongside all files to run the code.

Classical laminate theory shown in Section 5:
The 'CLT' folder contains the python code 'CLTTotal', as well as the data files with the posterior FEA input parameters.
